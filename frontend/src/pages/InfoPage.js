                    Cloudseeding is the creation of clouds, creation of storms, creation of wind, ice, snow, power. Its the power to
                    bring rainfall, to replenish water resources, to dissipate storms, to remove air pollutants. Not enough snow to 
                    ski on? Cloud seeding. Not enough water for crops? Cloudseeding. Severe weather? Cloud seeding. With a dispersal 
                    of silver iodide crystals, with a structure similar to ice, water droplets can latch on and grow into snow or rain.
                    Or the dispersal of select salts can attract moisture and create water droplets that amplify into precipitation.
                    Cloudseeding is the answer to many of our problems, but the conditions need to be just right. 
                    It requires a host of meteorologists, scientists, geologists on site to ensure that the implementation runs 
                    smoothly. More importantly, the location needs to be optimal. It can’t be too dry, but it also can’t be too wet.
                    Mountain valleys and ridges work best for their snow packing abilities, but deserts are viable and required locations
                    as well. It’s a delicate balance between a location, and it’s ability to cloud seed.

                    Which is where QloudSeeder comes in.

                    We take out the calculations, and utilize the power of quantum computing to find the best place to begin a 
                    cloud seeding. (ADD MORE)
