# cloudseeding

The goal of this project is to find the best cloud seeding locations to mitigate the effects of climate change on the ocean, while also highlighting the potential of quantum computing in solving sustainability problems. While our current focus is on practical cloud seeding strategies, we acknowledge the promising role that quantum computing could fill in the future.

To run this code locally, move to the cloudseeding directory and run
```sh
> make run-local
```
To run the code publicly, use the command
```sh
> make run-public
```
