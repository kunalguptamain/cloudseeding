# Qloudseeder

The goal of this project is to find the best cloud seeding locations to mitigate the effects of climate change on the ocean, while also highlighting the potential of quantum computing in solving sustainability problems. While our current focus is on practical cloud seeding strategies, we acknowledge the promising role that quantum computing could fill in the future.

To see our project in action, you'll need to install the requirements and run the code locally.

## Installation Requirements
- Node.js
- Python 3.9+

To install python modules, consider making a virtual environment:
```sh
> python -m venv .venv
```

Then move to the cloudseeding directory and run
```sh
> make install
```

## Running
To run this code locally, move to the cloudseeding directory and run
```sh
> make run
```
This will run the server and client. You can access the client at http://localhost:3000.
